FAST hands going five hole
Merkley has been really really good too
Kniazev making some plays
Mario Ferraro has impressed
Chmelevski hasn't

defense gave up a bad 2 on 1
Gregor was barely moving and put it five hole from like 6 feet away
Blichfield is quietly playing well
Halbgewachs is really fast
Chekovich again
He now has both his team's goals
Gregor with a nice dangle
Smakko at the net
Jacob McGrew ran right into the goalie
John Leonard scores nicely on the penalty shot
Ferraro just took a boarding penalty, but I have to say that I like his physicality overall
Chekovich just almost got his third goal, twice on one shift
The first one he stole it at the blue line and just took it straight in
Keaton Middleton is a big left side defenseman who's a liability on the breakout, but he's done some really nice things
Also putting together a good game
Yaroslav Alexeyev
Vladislav Kotkov is a big forward who scored a goal and I want to like him, but he hasn't played great
Just missed a pass that would have resulted in a tap in
Good job of right place right time, but bad touch
Chekovich took a penalty I didn't see
Blichfield good job pivoting and driving the slot
Outstanding battle between ferraro and chekovich
Fight!
It was actually a really good fight

Addenda:
-The players involved in the fight were #29 Zach Gallant and #45 Lean Bergmann
-Zach Gallant didn't have a particularly standout game, despite scoring the first goal of the game. However, the goal with the fight are intriguging, and at 6'2" 180 lbs, there might be enough in the combination of grit, size, and hockey sense to make him a worthwhile prospect (his goal found him in the right place at the right time when the puck squirted free to him off the boards)
-First goal is a good keep-in by Thomas Gregoire, a very good catch, pivot and pass by Blichfield and then finished off with a great pass by Halbgewachs to Gallant, who made a great read to head to the net as soon as the puck went low on the boards
